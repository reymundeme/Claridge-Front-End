          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-black mb-2">The Timeless Legacy of The Claridge Hotel and Brighton Park</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">The Claridge Hotel and Brighton Park are more than just landmarks—they are woven into the very fabric of American history. Perched on what is often considered the most coveted piece of land in Atlantic City, this site’s story dates back to the late 1700s when Jeremiah Leeds, the city’s founder, built his family settlement here.</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">For much of the 19th century, Atlantic City remained a pastoral landscape under the stewardship of the Leeds family. However, a turning point came when Dr. Jonathan Pitney established his medical practice on the island in the early 1800s. Revered for its healing properties, Atlantic City rapidly gained fame, and by the early 1900s, two major railroads were bringing eager visitors to the thriving coastal retreat. Train stations at Tennessee and Arkansas Avenues became the gateways to a new era of luxury, giving birth to Atlantic City’s reputation as the “Playground of the Gilded Age.”</p>
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-black mb-2">The Rise of The Claridge Hotel</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">Among the grand hotels that lined the shore, The Claridge stood out as the most opulent. Opening its doors in 1930 amidst the Great Depression, this 24-story marvel soared 370 feet high, earning the nickname "The Skyscraper by the Sea" for its Manhattan-inspired design. Adding to its allure, General Electric installed the Fountain of Light in Brighton Park to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Thomas Edison’s light bulb.</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">Setting new standards in hospitality, The Claridge was the first and only hotel to offer guests running hot and cold, fresh and saltwater—believed to have therapeutic benefits. Built by renowned Philadelphia contractor John McShain, who later played a pivotal role in constructing The Pentagon, The Kennedy Center, The Roosevelt Library, and renovations to The White House, The Claridge embodied architectural brilliance and luxury.</p>
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-black mb-2">A Hotel with a Storied Past</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">During World War II, Atlantic City transformed into a hub of military activity, and The Claridge played a key role by housing the United States Air Force. By 1943, as military operations subsided, the hotel became the epicenter of global diplomacy. That November, The Claridge hosted delegates from 44 nations for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) World Conference, a pivotal event aimed at “shortening the war and saving the peace.”</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">Among the distinguished attendees were Soviet Ambassador Andrei Gromyko, British Ambassador Lord Halifax, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The conference concluded with an expression of deep gratitude from international representatives, recognizing the warm hospitality of Atlantic City and The Claridge’s management.</p>
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-black mb-2">The Hotel of Legends</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">While The Claridge boasts an illustrious history, it has also been a haven for some of the world’s most iconic figures. The glamorous Marilyn Monroe stayed here during the 1950s when she served as Grand Marshal of the Miss America Pageant. Music legend Frank Sinatra, comedian Bob Hope, baseball great Mickey Mantle, civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and even Princess Grace of Monaco graced its halls.</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">Adding to its sports legacy, Mickey Mantle himself joined The Claridge in 1983 as Director of Sports Promotions. He became a beloved figure, meeting guests, playing golf, and hosting exclusive baseball events in the sixth-floor ballroom. Living at the hotel, Mantle made The Claridge his second home, attracting other Hall of Fame players to this Atlantic City gem.</p>
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-black mb-2">Preserving History, Embracing the Future</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black mb-4">Nearly eight decades and multiple ownerships later, The Claridge remains a beacon of elegance and exceptional service. In February 2014, TJM Atlantic City took ownership, ushering in a new chapter dedicated to preserving the hotel’s timeless charm while introducing modern amenities and experiences for today’s guests.</p>
          <p className="text-base text-black">The Claridge Hotel is more than just a destination—it’s a living legacy, where history, glamour, and hospitality continue to thrive. Whether stepping into its celebrated past or indulging in its luxurious present, visitors become part of a tradition that has defined Atlantic City for generations.</p>
